# Twelfth Man

Twelfth Man is a web application that aims to act as a scoring mechanism for cricket games.

## Motivations

As some of us are avid cricket players and enthusiasts, we found that an application like this would greatly help ease the otherwise tedious manual process of scoring a cricket game. We also added some other special features including creating user profiles, teams, tournaments and more!

## Installation

Once you have cloned the repository into your desired folder, perform the following steps:

1. Change directory to the frontend:

```bash
cd frontend
```

2. Start the frontend:

```bash
npm start
```

3. Change directory to the backend:

```bash
cd ..
cd backend
```

4. Start the backend:

```bash
npm start
```

The webpage should now be open in your default browser
